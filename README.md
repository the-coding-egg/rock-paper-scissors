# Rock Paper Scissors

This is my interpretation of The Odin Project.

Thank you to the team for putting this curriculum together!

Iterations:

1. Original RPS.
   - Used console.log for the game.

2. DOM Manipulation
   - Used DOM methods to create a basic UI
   - Most of the game is built with JS specifically

Follow for more iterations!
